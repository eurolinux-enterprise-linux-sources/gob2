Fri Jul 10 10:22:10 2009  Jiri (George) Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob2.1.in: fix the _GET_CLASS documentation.  Thanks to

	  stuff and have the private structure be allocated by glib

	* src/main.c, src/util.c: Apply patch from

	  Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org> to fix c++ compilation of linked

	  it on some occasions

	* src/main.c: destroywith and unrefwith function get cast with
	  reinterpret_cast when using --for-cpp and don't get cast at all

Tue Aug 10 16:32:00 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c, src/parse.y, src/treefuncs.def: Apply patch from

	* src/main.c, src/test.gob, src/Makefile.am, src/parse.y:  Fix for
	  -Wbad-function-cast which is kind of a moronic warning when it
	  comes to enums so in non-C++ mode just use the generic gint and
	  guint casts for enums and flags, on the other hand C++ really
	  requires the proper enum casts, go figure.

	* configure.in, NEWS: prepare for another release

Thu Jul 08 16:22:56 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: Rework the unused var warning avoidance since it was
	  causing different warnings.  I sort of now assume we're using
	  gcc if we want no warnings, other compilers will likely get
	  warnings in places.  But they probably got some warnings anyway.
	  Also fixup all kinds of other places that cause warnings to popup.

	* src/test.gob, src/Makefile.am:  Test for all kinds of warnings.

Fri Jun 11 15:16:05 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  to util and use it when making the boxed property set/get function
	  to fix boxed_type

Tue Apr 13 11:32:51 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob2.1.in: --always-private-header is NOT the default, but
	  --ondemand-private-header is the default.

Tue Mar 30 17:32:47 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.7

Tue Mar 30 17:27:32 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/checks.[ch], src/main.c: check for classwide members with
	  destructors and warn there, since our classes are all static,
	  we never destroy them anyway so this never happens.  It all
	  depends on your setup, so we cannot do some atexit or whatnot.
	  Also disallow BOXED or FLAGS in signal arguments since that doesn't
	  work anyway and you can use POINTER and UINT instead.

	* src/main.c, src/util.[ch]: fix the depracation fixing which broke
	  everything since g_strup/g_strdown had different semantics
	  then the new g_ascii_ versions.  So make our own
	  gob_strup/gob_strdown functions with the old semantics.

	* src/main.c: use our error function exclusively instead of g_error.

	* src/util.c: fix the error function to correctly follow exit_on_warn
	  and fix it when filename == NULL still

	* src/test.gob: fix the test wrt BOXED and FLAGS

Thu Feb 19 11:36:09 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob2.1.in: further stupidity fix

Thu Feb 19 11:31:40 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob2.1.in, doc/makehtml.pl: fix a small error with the
	  documentation and suppor the \& escape in the makehtml.pl script

Thu Feb 19 11:17:45 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l, src/Makefile.am: Apply patch from Albert Chin-A-Young
	  <china@thewrittenword.com> to fix compilation on IBMs C compiler,
	  by tweaking the includes and removing the -W options from AM_CFLAGS
	  as those are supported only by gcc

2003-02-08  Tomasz K³oczko <kloczek@pld.org.pl>

	* gob2.m4: Trivial fix: added missing [] quotation macro name
	  defined in AC_DEFUN() (neccessary for aclocal from automake 1.8.x
	  and backward compatible with older auto tools).

Tue Feb 03 12:57:45 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c, src/util.c: Apply patch from Kjartan Maraas
	  <kmaraas@broadpark.no> to remove use of deprecated functions

Wed Jan 21 09:24:12 2004  Nicolas Bruguier <gandalfn@club-internet.fr>

	* src/main.c: add INT64 and UINT64 type support for signal 
	  and propeties

Wed Aug 06 11:37:06 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob2.1.in: very minor fix from my inbox from apr 03
	  by Trevor Spiteri

Tue May 20 10:22:40 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.6

Tue May 20 10:18:10 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: fix some warnings related to newer automake

Thu May 15 09:53:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l: new flex is on drugs and it broke syntax (or
	  well the generated code defines) so this will actually make things
	  work with newer flex and still work with old flex (tested both
	  2.5.4a and 2.5.31).

Fri Feb 28 11:45:21 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob2.1.in: minor update

	  after the leading * in gtkdoc comments

2002-11-27  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* Release 2.1.3.1

2002-11-01  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* src/parse.y (ensure_property) : patch obvious borkage in using item3
	  in a production with 2 items.

Fri Nov 01 14:41:52 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  <Gerhard.Dieringer@nexgo.de>

	* src/main.c, src/util.c: Fix g_value_set/get for the unichar

	  UINT64 and INT64

Wed Sep 11 11:20:38 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: remove G_GNUC_CONST from the get_type, that seems to be

Tue Aug 20 11:01:52 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.2

Tue Aug 06 12:30:15 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  automatic urlization of email and web addresses

Tue Aug 06 12:08:20 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/test.gob: further tests

Tue Aug 06 12:06:07 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: damnit s/shutdown/dispose/, why does glib change
	  these on me.  I think there is an evil anti-gob plot in place.

	* src/test.gob: add a test for unrefwith (should have been there in
	  the first place to catch this)

	* doc/gob2.1.in: update the unref/unrefwith section

Mon Aug 05 11:11:01 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: properly link the BOXED type (use g_value_set_boxed)

	* src/main.c, src/parse.y: Fix extra property types but still
	  recognize if someone used the broken undocumented way which
	  worked.  Also fix object linking to not rely on GtkObject, and
	  fix BOXED linking as well.

	* src/test.gob: add some tests for the above

	* src/parse.y: fix C++ compilation for flags and enum linking

Mon Jul 15 13:05:18 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

Tue May 28 11:59:18 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: some compilation voodoo

	* src/main.c: Special case GtkEditable and GTypePlugin since
	  those end in Class, and all other interfaces should end in
	  Iface.  Long live code consistency!

	* src/main.c: use g_signal_emitv instead of g_signal_emit.  This
	  will allow us to once again have default returns and all that
	  fun stuff.  It should also slightly reduce emission overhead.

Mon Apr 15 09:55:29 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* README, COPYING.generated-code, Makefile.am: Add LGPL license
	  for generated code and clarify this in the README.  Meant to do
	  this a long time ago, and told everyone that who asked.  Now
	  it's in writing.

Sun Apr 14 19:12:02 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

Fri Feb 01 01:42:09 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: get rid of the old way of doing typesafe signal
	  connection and make a new way where there are full connect
	  macros for connect, connect_after and connect_data for each
	  signal.  A bit more heavy weight (only at compile time), but
	  it actually works, and is cleaner really.

2002-01-22  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* src/main.c: (make_arguments): move the get_ and set_property before
	parameters settings to work with latest glib

Thu Jan 10 22:05:42 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parser.y, src/lexer.l, src/main.c, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/test.gob, src/treefuncs.(def|c|h):  Implement using of
	  interfaces.  That is, you can now implement interfaces on your
	  objects.  You still can't define interfaces, that's step two.

Sun Dec 30 18:25:25 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: Apply patch from Josh Parsons <jp30@st-andrews.ac.uk>,
	  to fix some code generation

	* src/parse.y: Be anal in linking string properties.

Thu Dec 20 17:39:32 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: Apply patch from Josh Parsons <jp30@st-andrews.ac.uk>
	  to enhance the m4 support, fix init function generation and
	  correctly include glib-object.h.  Massage it a bit further as
	  well.

Mon Nov 05 11:45:46 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l, src/parser.y, src/main.c, src/treefuncs.def:
	  Add flags and enum creation code, so you can do things in
	  a more gob like manner rather then the glib-mkenums setup.

2001-10-27  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	Make BonoboObject stuff work, almost as much fun as
	blowing goats and twice as messy. Built code still
	requires a patch to libbonobo to run (changing the
	name of the TYPE macro to fit w/ GNOME standards),
	so retaining a warning that BonoboObject doesn't
	really work (oh, but it does :-)

	* configure.in:

	Make sure to substitute YFLAGS so you don't get undefined
	crap when you use @YFLAGS@ in Makefile.am.
	
	* src/main.c: (add_bonobo_object_get_type)

	Add a GObject type function for BonoboObject stuff.
	
	* src/main.c: (make_bonobo_object_epv)

	Append self_ to function call as per gob2.
	
	* src/main.c: (add_inits), (print_class_block)
	* src/parse.y:
	* src/treefuncs.c: (ensure_quarks), (copy_class), (copy_method),
	(free_class), (setv_class), (setv_method):
	* src/treefuncs.def:
	* src/treefuncs.h:

	Change to using BonoboObject rather than BonoboXObject.

	* examples/foo-some-interface.c

	Update to work with GOB2 with BonoboObjectTechnology(TM).
	
2001-10-26  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am:

	Add top_srcdir to the include flags to pick up config.h
	on my system.

Sat Oct 20 17:40:58 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: a few fixes

Sat Oct 20 16:59:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/Makefile.am: update

Sat Sep 29 16:44:13 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob2.1.in:  update a tad and add a note that the manual
	  is now out of date

Sat Sep 29 16:33:57 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gob2.spec.in: update for gob2

Fri Sep 28 17:39:57 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* **/*: Merge from gob-2 to HEAD

Fri Sep 28 17:08:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gob2.spec.in, gob2.m4, doc/gob2.1.in, Makefile.am,
	  doc/Makefile.am: rename rest of files for gob2

	* src/main.c: minor cleanup

Thu Sep 27 21:56:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/generate_treefuncs.pl, src/treefuncs.def, src/parse.y,
	  src/main.c:  Revamp the tree funcs stuff to be saner and cooler,
	  and fix some crashes and other things related to this.

	* src/parse.y, src/lexer.l, src/main.c, src/util.[ch],
	  src/checks.[ch], treefuncs.def:  Add properties (GParam), fix
	  C++ generation, add GET_NEW_VARG, whack the propname alias for
	  arguments setters/getters (they're deprecated anyway)

	* src/test.gob: update tests

Sun Sep 16 13:07:37 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: replace GOB_ prefix for local functions with
	  self_.  This makes much more sense.

Sun Sep 16 12:43:24 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l, src/parse.y, src/main.c, src/treefuncs.(def|c|h),
	  src/util.[ch], src/test.gob: Add syntax for properties (GParam
	  or whatever you call these:).  The code behind them is not yet
	  there though.

Sun Aug 12 16:15:46 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c, src/parse.y, src/test.gob, src/util.c:  Things now
	  make compilable objects, including with signals, how well it
	  works I don't know.  cpp support seems broken in glib mostly.

Sat Jun 30 15:01:26 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Applied the following from HEAD

 Sat Jun 30 14:57:37 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  examples.

 Sat Jun 09 13:38:53 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: was freeing the wrong token

 2001-06-03  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eskil.dk>

	* examples/my-person.gob:
	Fixed some comments
	
	* examples/test-export.gob:
	File that tests the (export) keyword.
	
	* src/parse.y:
	Added a (export) keyword to argument, so gob will
	autodefine the my_object_[get|set]_var functions.

Sun May 13 02:45:43 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: revert the GET_NEW_VARG since it just won't work
	  with non-gcc systems

Sun May 13 02:31:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: add GET_NEW_VARG macro/static func (for non-gcc)
	  and add TYPE_SELF macro

Sun May 13 02:02:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/util.c: patch from Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@mandrakesoft.com>
	  to fix warning

Sat Apr 21 20:06:10 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* examples/Makefile.am, examples/README,
	  examples/GNOME_Foo_SomeInterface.idl,
	  examples/foo-some-interface.gob:  Add an example for BonoboXObject

Sat Apr 21 19:33:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in:  Raise version to 1.0.9

	* src/lexer.l:  Properly check major version requirements (majors
	  must match in the requires line)

	* src/parse.y, src/main.c, src/treefuncs.(def|c|h), src/checks.c:
	  Add direct BonoboXObject support

	* src/parse.y: fix the chunks usage

	* doc/gob.1.in: document BonoboXObject stuff, fix the bugs section
	  wrt gtk-doc which has been supported for quite some time

Sat Apr 14 00:11:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: compile with glib 2.0

	* src/test.gob, src/Makefile.am: make the test glib pure, or mostly
	  so

	* src/lexer.l: added fixme

	* src/main.c: work on signals a little bit

Fri Apr 13 21:23:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/checks.[ch], src/lexer.l, src/main.c, src/parse.y,
	  src/treefuncs.[ch], src/treefuncs.def:  Work on gobject support,
	  based on the patch Sven sent me.  Also do add unref as well as
	  destroy handlers to vars, and moved the destructors to finalize and
	  unreffers to shutdown.  This all compiles, but that doesn't mean it
	  makes usable objects.

Fri Apr 13 17:45:14 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y, doc/gob.1.in: Fix a problem found by Eric Kidd
	  <eric.kidd@pobox.com>, where objectlink was not completely
	  refcounting safe.  Could underref if you set the same object.

Sat Mar 31 00:24:58 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: fix crash with marshallers of signals with a return
          type and no arguments.

Sun Mar 04 19:14:03 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c, src/checks.c, src/util.[ch]:  Remove the underscore
	  hack, remove the 1.2 code from the 1.3 compat hacks, make all
	  short names start with GOB_.  Start of the direct GObject
	  support, gob compiles, but it will not create useful object
	  files yet.

Tue Feb 27 06:14:59 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, README: this is the gob-2 branch
	  for GObject support

Tue Feb 27 00:53:41 2001  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* README: Use my new-found maintainer status!!! The power!

	* src/Makefile.am: fix the build

2001-02-08  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: Remove BUILT_SOURCES stuff; Automake knows how
	to handle .l and .y files directly, and including the .c files as
	well was making it fail to link as it would try to link in lexer.o
	and parse.o twice.

Thu Feb 08 02:43:22 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c:  add signal connection typesafety macros

	* src/test.gob, doc/gob.1.in: new stuff foo

	* configure.in: raise version

Thu Feb 08 01:42:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: rule for parse.h includes parse.c, and
	  SOURCES include BUILT_SOURCES

Tue Dec 26 11:03:44 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: Remove ## from the varargs macro stuff, as it's not
	  needed and causes trouble for newer gcc's (like in rh7)

Sun Sep 10 18:04:07 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.5

Fri Sep 01 03:45:30 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: add G_GNUC_CONST to the _get_type function

Wed Aug 23 15:05:40 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: when a method has no arguments make an argumentless
	  macro for the shortform to avoid a parse error

	* src/test.gob: add a test for the above

Sun Aug  6 22:21:38 2000  Eskil Heyn Olsen <eskil@eazel.com>
	
	* gob.m4 now defaults to WARN instead of ERROR on missing
	gob.

Tue Jul 25 16:54:34 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.4

	* configure.in: raise version to 1.0.4

	* src/main.c: fixup the -anal macro patch.

	* src/util.[ch], src/main.c: constize (not in 1.0.4)

	* src/main.c: the short form pointers unified for both gnu and non-gnu
	  (not in 1.0.4)

Sun Jul 23 18:51:45 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/util.[ch], src/main.c, src/checks.c, src/lexer.l, src/parse.y:
	  make new cleaner error print routines including a printfstyle one.
	  Use the get_real_id on all method ids even for overrides.  When a
	  signal is added there is also a sizeof check for the signature vs.
	  argument list with a g_error if it fails.  Fix %at{ %} to not
	  appear twice in all files.

	* src/main.c: Apply patch from Arturo Tena to make things compile
	  nicely with gcc's -ansi -pedantic

	* src/out.[ch]: constize correctly and use G_GNUC_PRINTF macro for
	  warnings.

Fri Jul 21 15:38:10 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: store the private structure pointer so that we
	  don't look inside the freed object structureafter finalize

Thu Jul 06 02:32:29 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.3

Wed Jul 05 19:37:20 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{main.c,parse.y}: couple of cleanups, and fixup the gtk 1.3
	  support

Wed Jul 05 18:57:13 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{checks.c, main.c, parse.y, test.gob}:  Apply and fix up patch
	  from Bas van der Linden <linden@win.tue.nl> that adds the ability
	  to use const on the "self" argument as well.  Also adds a CONST
	  casting macro to use.

	* src/main.c: Fix a memory leak when destroy wasn't overriden and
	  destructors were added, it now properly calls the parent handler.
	  Same with finalize.

	* src/main.c: Spit out some macro magic foo to hopefully make it
	  possible to compile objects with GTK+ 1.3/2.0

	* doc/gob.1.in, examples/*.gob:  We should never do
	  GTK_OBJECT(GET_NEW) as that's a memory leak due to some weird
	  GTK_OBJECT() semantics

Fri Jun 30 14:08:53 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.2

Fri Jun 30 13:11:05 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob.1.in: add doc for --always-private-struct

	* src/main.c: fix output of --help.  Also print __GOB_FUNCTION__
	  for inits and for get/set_arg.  And print the get_real_id to
	  avoid the underscore.

Mon Jun 26 00:06:45 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: for stringlink, dup the string on argument
	  getting

	* doc/gob.1.in: update documentation to the above change

Sun Jun 25 03:34:02 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/treefuncs.def, src/main.c, src/utils.[ch], src/parse.y: sane
	  parsing of const.  Get rid of "stars" integer and just use a
	  "pointer" string.  Also the types in general are more sanely parsed,
	  thus recognizing hopefully all legal (and some illegal) C types.

	* src/checks.[ch], src/main.c: checks the argument type to be one we can
	  truly check.

	* src/treefuncs.def, src/main.c, src/parse.y, src/lexer.l:  Apply
	  patch from Bas van der Linden <linden@win.tue.nl> that adds the
	  possibility to use chunks to allocate objects.

	* src/main.c: Apply patch from Bas van der Linden <linden@win.tue.nl>
	  to add a __GOB_FUNCTION__ define to each function

	* src/Makefile.am, src/main.c, src/lexer.l, src/generate_treefuncs.pl:
	  avoid and fix warnings, and compile with all warnings

	* src/main.[ch]: add an --always-private-struct option to always put
	  in the private pointer, even if there are no private members.

	* src/test.gob: add some more tests for new stuff

Wed Jun 07 15:03:18 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.1

Wed Jun 07 14:41:24 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, doc/gob.1.in: updates

Mon Jun 05 12:10:46 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob.1.in: run through ispell, and fix option stuff to produce
	  nicer html output with groff

Thu Jun 01 18:12:13 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: Make the private header switches work again.

Wed May 31 01:50:25 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 1.0.0

Wed May 31 01:47:23 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/gob.1.in: documentation of makefile rules for gob.

Tue May 30 11:02:36 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l: Accept identifiers in array dimensions, this is so
	  that you can make these some constants.

Sat May 20 18:22:33 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.93.5

Sat May 20 18:22:23 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{main.c,checks.[ch]}: check for duplicate overrides, it is
	  different from checking symbol names as they don't conflict with
	  other symbols AND they only conflict if both the name and their
	  type match

Sat May 20 16:38:06 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{main.[ch],util.[ch],checks.c}: Add underscore removal for
	  non-override methods.  This means that local aliases will include
	  prepended underscores, but when the full name is generated, or
	  when the method name is added to class structure, the underscore
	  is removed.

	* src/checks.c: overrides no longer checked for uniqueness, a more
	  complex logic is needed.

	* src/{main.c,treefuncs.def,parse.y}:  override naming is done
	  with a unique id, so that we handle cases where two classes have
	  the same method name.

	* doc/gob.1.in: update for the above.

Sat May 20 14:42:00 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: the private structure is now freed in finalize again and
	  thus do the same dance around finalize as we do around destroy. 
	  Clean up some code.  NULL all things being destroyed.  The arbitary
	  destructor uses memset as those things might not be just pointers.

Thu May 11 23:48:44 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.[ch]: provide the Self and SelfClass typedefs in addition
	  to SELF, IS_SELF, SELF_CLASS macros.  All of these can now be
	  disabled with the --no-self-alias option

	* doc/gob.1.in: update

	* configure.in: raise version

Tue May 09 23:18:16 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: fix segfault on parse error and give better error
	  message

Tue May 09 21:54:10 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob.1.in, src/main.c:  Add destruction code into the destroy
	  handler rather then finalize.  Setup an extra function if
	  neccessary to handle returns correctly as this must be called
	  after any user code.

Sat Apr 29 14:41:42 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.93.4

Sat Apr 29 14:40:40 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/checks.c: code prettification

	* src/lexer.l, src/parse.y, src/test.gob: change "class" scope to
	  "classwide" scope, not to overload the class keyword

	* src/main.[ch]: make private header files be generated by default,
	  and cleanup that part a bit

	* doc/gob.1.in: add documentation of classwide

	* NEWS:

Fri Apr 21 17:15:09 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: add spaces after commas

	* src/lexer.l, src/main.c, src/parse.y: add class scope variables
	  which are put into the class structure

	* src/test.gob: added a test for class variables

	* src/treefuncs.def: added CLASS_SCOPE

	* src/treefuncs.h: regenerated

Mon Apr 17 20:13:47 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: on objectlink instead of just ref, do ref/sink.

Sat Apr 15 23:07:30 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.93.3

Sat Apr 15 22:42:20 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: fixes for ANSI C and C++.  Just use GTK_VALUE_POINTER
	  instead of GTK_VALUE_OBJECT so that we don't have to cast and don't
	  cast lvalues.

Sat Apr 15 22:09:49 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: use the generic return type in signal marshallers
	  rather then the specific one as the marshallers are truly generic

Sat Apr 15 21:52:52 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: fix some typesafety braindamages with OBJECT types
	  in arguments by casting GTK_VALUE_OBJECT to gpointer.  Also
	  for seting arguments cast the ARG to atype if it exists

Wed Apr 05 13:42:28 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: never allow NONE to be used as one of many arguments,
	  always only by itself in the argument list

	* src/main.c: When printing out the signal marshaller prototype,
	  don't print out the NONE (void) into the argument list, thanks
	  to Soeren Sandmann <sandmann@daimi.au.dk> for reporting that

Mon Apr 03 13:07:33 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* examples/Makefile.am: add my-person2.gob to EXTRA_DIST

Sun Apr 02 18:09:40 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.93.2

Sun Apr 02 17:38:12 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: ass the .pl and .def file to EXTRA_DIST

Sun Apr  2 14:37:49 PDT 2000 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: check for treefuncs.h instead of tree.h, since
	  the latter has gone bye-bye

Sat Apr 01 23:27:47 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob.1.in: add documentation for defreturn

Sat Apr 01 18:03:31 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{treefuncs.(def|c|h),generate_treefuncs.pl}: What would gob
	  be without some automatically generated code.  The tree.[ch] was
	  hard to keep up and didn't have free/copy so these do, otherwise
	  it is the same.  Also added a defreturn field to methods

	* src/*.[cyl]: include treefuncs.h rather then tree.h

	* src/{parse.y,lexer.l,main.c}: use the defreturn as the default for
	  return values of signals and virtual methods.  If this is not
	  defined use the onerror or failing that '0'.  onerror is also not
	  a reserved keyword anymore
	
	* configure.in: raise version

Mon Mar 27 13:08:01 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.93.1

Mon Mar 27 12:04:22 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/util.[ch], src/main.c: figure out if we really need the special
	  types, also make a hash for the gtk types instead of linear
	  searching it all the time.

	* src/{lexer.c,checks.c,main.c}: minor fixes and cleanups

2000-03-21  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <deity@eskil.dk>

	* gob.m4: do not default GOB to no when not found (did that make
	sense ?)
	And better error message.

Mon Mar 20 14:35:35 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l: handle single word typenames with an empty namespace

Sun Mar 05 02:23:04 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: add #lines around setting default handlers

	* src/parse.y: fix line number for 'destroywith' destructors

Sat Mar 04 15:33:18 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/checks.c: duplicate name test for arguments and signals is
	  case insensitive now as those could cause trouble

Mon Feb 28 02:45:27 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.93.0

Sun Feb 27 20:59:45 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y,doc/gob.1.in: For stringlink, just return a pointer on
	  get rather then strduping as that is 1) consistent with objectlink
	  and 2) more flexible.

Sun Feb 27 20:38:19 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{main.c,tree.[ch],parse.y}: add the arbitrary destruction handler
	  for data members

	* NEWS,doc/gob.1.in,examples/{README,my-person.gob,my-person2.gob}:
	  update of docs and examples to include the new features and minor
	  fixups

Sun Feb 27 04:41:41 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: make the output nicer for classes with no methods
	  better typechecking in get/set_arg, fix a couple of C++ issues,

	* src/{main.c,parse.y,tree.[ch]}: automatic linking of arguments to
	  data members.  Also alow empty statements inside a class.  Also
	  add automatic data member destruction for pointer data, and
	  automatic initialization for any data member.

	* src/main.[ch],src/out.c: add --no-lines which inhibits printing
	  of #line things to output files

	* doc/gob.1.in: update for the above

Fri Feb 25 15:21:47 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob.1.in: add docs for the above

Fri Feb 25 01:37:20 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: fix trailing comma on the end of the argument enum

	  in naming

Sat Feb 12 14:42:15 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c,src/lexer.l: apply patches from Dave Dunkin
	  <dunkind@letu.edu> to add all and alltop ccode sections
	  and to add a --no-write,-n option to not actually write
	  any files.  Also did some very cosmetic changes to code

Mon Feb 07 23:45:04 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: use the magic /*< private >*/ and /*< public >*/
	  comments to distinguish public and protected data members

Mon Feb 07 03:02:48 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.92.3

Mon Feb 07 02:50:11 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l: error on multiple classes

Fri Feb 04 01:07:54 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: use G_GNUC_UNUSED rather then our own macro for a
	  very slightly cleaner looking output file

2000-01-31  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <deity@eskil.dk>

	* gob.m4: checks for gob binary, GOB_CHECK([version [,
 	action_if_found[, action_if_not_found]]]).  

	* Makefile.am: Install gob in $prefix/share/aclocal

Thu Jan 27 17:50:11 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: add #include <stdlib.h>

Mon Jan 24 22:52:47 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.92.2

Mon Jan 24 22:23:47 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: add a protecting define before the object typedef

	* doc/gob.1.in: add docs for the new stuff

Sun Jan 23 16:19:54 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{lexer.l,parse.y,tree.[ch],main.c}: make more types of header
	  %{ %} blocks, "headertop" and "privateheader" and made short as
	  well as long names possible.

	* src/main.c: add an --no-extern-c option to not put entern "C" into
	  the output, which is now put in by default even if --for-cpp is
	  on so that it is possible to call those from C by default

Thu Jan 20 01:50:45 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: put the _real_ functions in our normal private
	  namespace of ___* to be more consistent.

Mon Jan 10 00:16:43 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{main.[ch],util.[ch],checks.[ch]}: offload some functionality to
	  extra files

	* src/main.c: cleanup the generation routine by spliting it up into
	  more functions
	  
	* src/{main.h,lexer.l,parse.y,out.c}: put some needed externs into the
	  main.h file and include that rather then doing it in the .c files

Thu Jan 06 18:33:44 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: use ___ for the signal marshalling typedefs as well

Thu Jan 06 17:32:46 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.92.1

Thu Jan 06 17:13:22 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: be consistent with the use of "namespacing", we
	  prefix ALL internal gob stuff with "___".  This should make it
	  easier to avoid name conflicts with user code and glibc/gcc (Which
	  seems to use __ prefix)

	* src/main.c: check for init and class_init names for non-constructor
	  methods and give an error if found.

	* src/main.c: check argument types and flags for correctness, error
	  on unknown type, but just a warning on unknown flag

	* doc/gob.1.in: add a section for name conflicts

Wed Jan 05 02:23:21 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: doh! the symbols for the aliases need to be declared as
	  static.

Wed Jan 05 02:13:59 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: just realized that args... for macros is a GNU
	  extention and so the PARENT_HANDLER no longer uses it, but prints
	  the argument names with __ prefixed into the argument list.

Wed Jan 05 01:58:32 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: if using gnu c, also define macros using varargs for
	  function aliases.  This should allow the compiler to optimize
	  further and if we have arguments for the defines there are
	  no adverse side effects as there are for straight defines.

Wed Jan 05 01:48:12 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: fixup the aliases.  They didn't actually work right.
	  now we set it up as a const pointer to a function using typeof.

Tue Jan 04 17:57:55 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l: add support for 'requires x.y.z' line.  This is
	  so that a .gob file can require at least version x.y.z of gob

	* src/test.gob: update

	* doc/gob.1.in: update for requires and run trhough ispell

Tue Jan 04 17:10:54 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: fix the non-gnu aliases

Tue Jan 04 16:46:16 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{main.c,parser.y,tree.[ch]}: add optional C type specification
	  to arguments for full type safety 

	* doc/gob.1.in: updated

Tue Jan 04 15:34:16 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: --no-gnu option to completely disable any use
	  of GNU C extentions.  This is for those weird people that don't
	  wish to use those extentions even with GNU C.

Tue Jan 04 14:43:49 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: use some GNU extentions (guarded with #ifdef __GNUC__)
	  to make arguments fully typesafe, and to make it easier for
	  GNU to optimize the aliases, as well as to avoid the ugly
	  hack on GNU C.

	* src/main.c: don't put #line 0 for the .gob file for method prototypes

	* src/main.c: move the _priv structure freeing into finalize to enable
	  people to work with the private stuff inside the destroy handler

	* src/main.c: use #line before every precondition check so that failed
	  checks should point to the function prototype rather then into
	  generated file.

	* src/main.c: remove the _END_ARG macro

	* src/main.c: add GOB_VERSION_MAJOR, GOB_VERSION_MINOR and
	  GOB_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL defines into the generated C file

	* src/out.c: don't redundantly put #line for outfile if we're already
	  in the outfile

	* configure.in: raise version number

Tue Jan 04 02:22:33 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: add argument wrapper macros to make the argument system
	  a little more type safe.

Fri Dec 31 17:39:22 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.92.0

Thu Dec 30 20:20:36 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: correctly handle the complex fundemental types,
	  so that we can handle ALL the fundemental types for signals

Thu Dec 30 19:29:56 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: don't use function types for casts in marshallers,
	  but default types we get from our GTK_TYPE_* -> C type translation,
	  and use this fact to check for same function types and combine
	  signal prototypes.  This doesn't yet handle well complex types,
	  but I have an idea how to make complex types work.  Though
	  I dunno if it's actually worth it.

Thu Dec 30 17:18:27 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: figure out some types from GTK types and cast properly
	  when emitting a signal.  This catches some inconsistencies in
	  signal func argument lists and the GTK types of the arguments.

Wed Dec 29 18:04:13 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: allow scope, public/private/protected, to come before
	  the signal or virtual keyword for consistency's sake.

Wed Dec 29 01:39:30 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{tree.[ch],parser.y}: cleanup scope stuff

	* src/{lexer.l,parser.y,tree.h,main.c}: add protected keyword and
	  methods.  protected methods are put into the -private files and
	  are real exported functions just like public.  protected data
	  members act like pre-0.91.x private datamembers, that is they
	  get stuck into the public header, but marked /* protected */.

	* src/main.c: change the method body printing function so that we
	  can catch the no return warning properly and send us to the .gob
	  file instead of the .c file.

	* src/{parse.y,main.c}: handle empty publics/privates/overrides
	  and handle the body being set to ';' rather then '{}'

	* src/main.c: check for empty nonvoid regular methods, and error out
	  on finding them as that would produce warnings which we can't catch
	  and it is generally bad to do anyway

	* src/{parse.y,tree.[ch],main.c}: use char pointers for C buffers,
	  and kill leading/trailing whitespace from them to make the C files
	  nicer and easier to recognize empty functions.

	* src/main.c: add a --version switch

	* doc/gob.1.in: Update with the above changes

	* configure.in: raise version

Tue Dec 28 20:49:56 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: apply patch from ChiDeok Hwang <cdhwang@sr.hei.co.kr>
	  to make the hack function static so that we don't pollute namespace

Mon Dec 27 19:56:24 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.91.2

Mon Dec 27 03:00:25 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: fixup PARENT_HANDLER to work well with non-void
	  functions, the macro becomes an expression if the function is
	  not void and returns the return of the parent or the onerror
	  expression if the function pointer was NULL.

Mon Dec 27 02:25:32 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: allow completely empty classes

	* src/main.c: don't add the ugly hack function if there are no
	  methods

Mon Dec 27 01:26:26 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: fixup the virtual rule as I forgot to shift the
	  argument numbers when adding to the expression

Mon Dec 27 01:07:14 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: add optional public keyword to virtuals and signals,
	  (which doesn't do anything, only consistency). I should perhaps
	  rewrite and simplify this part of the parser

	* src/lexer.l: fix a bug with empty braces producing a segfault
	  on public and private methods

	* doc/gob.1.in: add a section about Constructor methods (init
	  class_init) and fix init_class -> class_init

	* configure.in: raise version to 0.91.2

Tue Dec 14 00:06:00 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.91.1

Mon Dec 13 23:25:06 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{main.c,out.c}: create a private header file and stick
	  the private structure definition inside it.  Add option
	  --no-private-header for 0.91.0 behaviour and
	  --always-private-header to force private header creation

	* doc/gob.1.in: update WRT above changes

	* examples/my-person.gob: include the private header

	* NEWS: update

Mon Dec 13 18:30:09 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: don't print spurious #line's into the private
	  structure

	* src/{main.c,tree.[ch],lexer.l,parse.y}: implement support for 
	  array types for data members and function arguments

Mon Dec 13 00:48:47 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.91.0

Sun Dec 12 22:55:12 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob.1.in: added paragraph noting that private data members
	  cannot be accessed above the class definition in the .gob file

Sun Dec 12 22:08:31 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: implement real private data members as promised in
	  the documentation, this however breaks some compatiblity with
	  things that already used the 'private' keyword for data members

	* doc/gob.1.in: document private data member stuff

	* NEWS: update

	* src/main.c: a couple of sanity checks of the code to prevent weird
	  errors on some broken .gob code

	* configure.in: update version to 0.91.0

Sun Dec 05 14:20:26 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{lexer.l,main.c}: if we find the class header #include
	  statement in a %{ %} section above class definition, don't
	  include it ourselves.

	* doc/gob.1.in: remove the note about the include always first from
	  BUGS, and make a new section for the include file.

Thu Nov 25 13:09:08 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.90.5

Thu Nov 25 13:00:52 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: don't error out on a symbol conflict if the types of
	  the symbol node don't match (variable,method)

Sat Nov 20 16:15:42 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: add PARENT_HANDLER macro to make calling parent
	  handlers in override functions easier

Fri Nov 19 16:41:09 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: add a type macro

Thu Nov 18 22:56:09 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/parse.y: add a warning check if the number of GTK types of
	  a signal doesn't seem to be correct for the given number of
	  function arguments

Tue Nov 16 01:23:45 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: support a "no-touch-headers" mode in which the
	  headers are not touched unless they actually really changed,
	  not on by default as it confuses automake

Tue Nov 16 00:36:42 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{main.c,lexer.l,parser.y,out.c}: Implement a C++ mode, get
	  rid of C++ errors/warnings when in C++ mode, and get rid of
	  the 'this' pointer finally (it's been deprecated long enough)

Mon Nov 15 23:45:37 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: add prototype for the really bad hack function to
	  avoid warning

Mon Nov 15 23:42:06 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: generate correct function pointers in the structure
	  for signals and virtuals.  Also use a much nicer system instead
	  of the method name defines, we now just set a bunch of static
	  pointers, this removes a whole lot of headaches actually

	* doc/gob.1.in: repair to reflect the above (I removed the define
	  BUGS paragraph)

Sun Nov 14 17:57:34 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob.1.in: repair some things that confused troff and add
	  a C preprocessor warning to BUGS

Sat Nov 13 17:22:49 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* **/Makefile.am, configure.in: fix the conditional installation
	  stuff, don't even go into the doc directory if we aren't installing

Sat Nov 13 16:53:20 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob.1.in: describe BUGS better

Sat Nov 13 16:20:41 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/lexer.l: don't kill C++ style comments from C blocks

Sat Nov 13 16:16:59 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{lexer.l,main.c,out.c}: fixed spurious newline printing, don't
	  kill comments from C blocks so that line counts are right, accept
	  newlines in strings, and don't take \'\"\' as a string delimiter

Sat Nov 13 14:53:26 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/main.c: don't add gtk_object_class to class_init if we only
	  have non-GtkObject overrides to avoid warning

Sat Nov 13 14:31:25 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in,src/Makefile.am,doc/Makefile.am: check for
	  ../NOINST_GOB and in case it's found don't install self

Fri Nov 12 16:25:35 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in,Makefile.am,src/main.c: don't use popt, our arguments
	  are simple enough and popt doesn't seem to be widely used yet

Sun Sep 05 22:08:40 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 0.90.2

Sun Sep 05 22:08:33 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* doc/gob.1.in: updated for private virtual and signal wrappers

Sun Sep 05 21:50:19 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version and actually set POPT_LIB correctly

	* src/Makefile.am: use POPT_LIB

	* src/main.[ch],parse.y: make error/warning reporting public
